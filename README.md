# Processing-Meteor Examples

## Meteor App
Inside the processingMeteorExampleApp is a meteor app that is ready to run. [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) and `meteor` inside the directory. The Processing sketches assumes that you run the app in *localhost:3000*.

## Processing sketches

* **meteor_connect** : A basic sketch to connect to the Meteor App. It has a DDPListener, which gets update everytime the collection is modified. Note that it does not use the `draw` function, alternatively redraws every time it needs to.


## TODO

* make more simple examples, meteor_connect is more like java!!!
* try authenticating.
